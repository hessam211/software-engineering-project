# Sony Betamax
Sony launched its cassette recording device known as Betamax in the mid 1970s. It lost the battle for market share to JVC’s VHS technology, but Sony didn’t stop making Betamax tapes until 2016, long after it was relevant to most of us, who didn’t even realize it was still in production.

## Lessons Learned:

+ The story of Betamax has become nearly synonymous with failed marketing because while it was innovative and hit the market before its competition did, other products proved to be cheaper and better.

+ The lesson learned here is that project management doesn’t end when a project is launched or a campaign has run its course. Successful projects are followed up on, analyzed, and evaluated so they can maintain their velocity and continue to benefit the company’s bottom line.
