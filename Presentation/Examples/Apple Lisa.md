# Apple Lisa
Lisa, the first desktop with a mouse, cost $10,000 (almost $24,000 today) and had just 1 MB of RAM. Consumers weren’t as interested as Apple anticipated, and it was a case of over promising and under delivering, as the 1983 ads—featuring Kevin Costner—depicted the Lisa as much more than it really was.

## Lessons Learned:

+ Transparency matters. It may feel like a buzzword you hear all the time, but there’s no better way to describe the lesson learned here other than to say that Apple was not transparent enough about the Lisa.

+ We no longer live in an age where you can falsify the capabilities of a product, because social media makes it easier for the truth to come out and word of mouth will eventually catch up to—and destroy—projects that lack transparency.
